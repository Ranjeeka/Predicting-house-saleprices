# Predicting-house-saleprices
In this project we transform, clean and prep data to fit into Linear Regression model and predict Sale prices of houses using features in the dataset. 
We start with transformation and fitting of numerical values and compare predicitons with predicitons after categorical values (converted to numerical values) are added to the feature list resulting in a much better RMSE value and R2 score.
